# quantum-study-toolkit

Simple .devcontainer setup with the scope of being quantum computing toolkit


## Prerequisites

- A container system installed that works with vscode
  - For Windows 10: Docker Desktop
    - -WARNING:-  If git push/pull gives you `http.sslBackend schannel` errors, remove it from your `~/.gitconfig`
- vscode
  - Extensions:
    - `azuretools.vscode-docker`
    - `ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack`

## Quick Start

- clone this repo to your computer
- start VSCODE and open the cloned repo as working folder/project
- Make sure the Docker daemon is running!
- Click the button that says to open in a container
  - Note: if the popup doesn't show it self hit `F1` and the start to type `Rebuild` and you should see `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`
- Wait for the container to download/build

## Usage

There are two ways to us this set:

1. Inside VSCODE
   - Raw python coding
   - Jupyter notebooks extension.

2. Using Jupyter Notebooks webgui
    - After the container is up and running 
      - copy the token that is autogenerated or
      - in shell run `jupyter server list` to get the token
    - goto http://localhost:8888  (or whatever port you setup)
    - paste in the initial access token and setup a password


### Issues you may run into

You get what is shown below, just follow the instructions if needed

```sh
>>>git status
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/home/jovyan/work'
To add an exception for this directory, call:

        git config --global --add safe.directory /home/jovyan/work
```

```sh
>>>git pull
fatal: Unsupported SSL backend 'schannel'. Supported SSL backends:
        gnutls
```

Unsupported SSL backend is likely using Docker Desktop on windows.  Fix: unset/clear http.sslbackend   
`git config --global --unset http.sslbackend`
